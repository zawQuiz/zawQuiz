```

```bash
cd server
npm run watch:ts
```

In the third (frontend):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run watch
```

## Tests

### Unit tests:

```bash
cd server
npm run test:unit
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:unit
```

### E2E tests:

End-to-end tests are made with cypress framework, you should run them before commiting to catch up potential bugs:

```bash
cd frontend

```

If you want to see graphic course of testing - run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e:browser
```
